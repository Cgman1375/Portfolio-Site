                        <p>
                           I was Born and raised in Brooklyn NY, growing up in NYC I was surrounded by art, on the trains, walls, it was just everywhere so I eventually just started to draw.I was horrible at first but then I met (I'm not going to say any names) some really talented street artist. I eventually found myself hanging out at the train yards in Coney Island. Needless to say my father(the picture above) was not happy with the company I kept, so my career as a grafitti artist ended.

                           My father wanted to expose me to other types of art. He took me to every museum in NY, The Met, Guggenheim, 
                           and the American Museum of natural history just to name a few. From that point I learned about 1,2, and 3 point perspective, gestural posing, and still life. Later on in life I attended SVA, only for a year, way toooooo expensive so i transfered to Full Sail Real World Education, yes it's a design school, they're not teaching about sailing.Thats where I learned about Computer animation and the rest is History.
